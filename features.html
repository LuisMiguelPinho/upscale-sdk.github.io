<ol>
  <li><em>Compiler  flow.</em> This flow has a twofold objective: 
	<ol>
		<li>to guide the  process to generate the binary that will execute on the many-core architecture  and</li>
		<li>to generate the application <em>Direct  Acyclic Graph</em> (DAG) used for the timing analysis and run-time components.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
  <li><em>Analysis  flow</em>. This flow is in charge of deriving timing guarantees  of the parallel execution considering execution time traces of the application  running on the many-core platform and incorporated in the DAG. Timing  guarantees are derived by means of execution time bounds and static scheduler  or dynamic scheduler supported with response time analysis.</li>
  <li><em>Execution  stack</em>. These two components are in charge of orchestrating  the parallel execution of the application in a time predictable manner, based  on the DAG. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Compiler  flow</h3>
<p>The compiler  must pave the way towards a reliable and predictable timing and schedulability  analyses. The compiler flow of the UpScale SDK guides the process of generating  the binary that will execute on the many-core architecture and creates the  interface that glues the different SDK components. It: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Transforms OpenMP directives to the  corresponding set of run-time calls;</li>
  <li>Builds the OpenMP-DAG required to  perform timing and schedulability analysis, and derive a static task-to-thread  allocation if configured for higher predictability;</li>
  <li>Automatically generates the set of data  structures needed to store the DAG into the application's memory address space;  and</li>
  <li>Instruments the code to measure the  execution time of the different parts of the application, i.e. task-parts and  run-time overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Execution  stack </h3>
<p>It is paramount that the OpenMP run-time and  operating system components understand the target hardware design and  incorporate all the features required to orchestrate an efficient and  predictable parallel execution of the real-time tasks. UpScale provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A  lightweight OpenMP runtime that support the lightweight execution of the OpenMP  accelerator (target directive) and tasking models on the Kalray MPPA 256  platform</li>
  <li>The  ERIKA3 RTOS, designed to add proper support for multi-core architectures, by  using one single kernel image across several cores. </li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>
<h3>Analysis  tools</h3>
<p>Meeting both the timing and high-performance requirements  for parallel real-time applications which aim at executing on the last generations of many-core  processors requires a deep insight into the interactions between the tasks  at run-time. To this  end, the set of tools that allow the system designer to gather the tasks&rsquo; maximum  execution times on the  target processor as well as to conduct a sound timing and schedulability  analyses in various hardware setups is critical. The UpScale SDK Analysis  toolbox is composed of the <em>Analyser </em>and<em> the Mapper</em>. It provides the tools to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>model,  measure, analyse and optimize the system to reach the desired goals</li>
  <li>to  rapidly identify the bottlenecks and create &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios regarding how  to perform the task-to-core mappings at run-time.</li>
</ul>
